  abstract = {Conventionally, cross-layer designs with same timescale updates can
	work well; however, there is a difference in layers' timescales and
	each layer normally operates at its corresponding timescale when
	implemented in real systems. To respect this issue, in this article,
	we introduce a multitimescale cross-layer design along with three
	sets of constraints: congestion control, link delay, and power control
	and with the objective of maximizing the overall utility and minimizing
	the total link delay and power consumption. The proposed procedure
	can be implemented in a distributed fashion, which not only guarantees
	truly optimal solutions to the underlying problem, but also adheres
	to the natural timescale difference among layers. Finally, the numerical
	results further solidify the efficacies of our proposal compared
	to the current frameworks.},

  abstract = {All-optical network has been received many attention from researchers
	due to the obvious fact of light speed. Several solutions to an all-optical
	backbone network solution have been proposed, however, not completely
	yet due to lack of all-optical technologies such as optical buffer,
	optical monitor, optical packet separation, etc. To handle important
	requirements for near future internet while still consider the lack
	of current technologies, Optical Burst Switching has been proposed
	as one of the most suitable candidates. In such network, one of the
	important issues is how to manage burst flows efficiently includes
	burst contention, when multiple data bursts with the same destination
	are simultaneously destined for an intermediate output port. The
	primary research objectives of this thesis are to build comprehensive
	system models and propose new schemes to tackle burst contention
	issue. First, we develop a queuing model considering impatience features
	of burst flow to reduce burst loss ratio in single-wavelength optical
	burst switching networks. Second, we extend the model and propose
	a novel feedback-based scheme to dynamically control burst loss ratio
	in multi-wavelength optical burst switching networks. We also develop
	a simulator in OMNeT++ simulation framework for National Science
	Foundation Network topology based on the optical burst switching
	technique. Simulation results demonstrate our schemes work better
	in comparison to other approaches in terms of reducing and stabilizing
	burst loss ratio and other performance criteria also.},

  abstract = {We consider optical delay line buffer as a solution to reduce the
	number of lost burst in optical burst switching, one of the promising
	candidates for future networks. Such network takes burst loss as
	an important performance criteria in the design step. Network performance,
	however, cannot be captured efficiently using traditional queueing
	models, because they often ignore the impatience of messages traveling
	through optical switches which is one of the popular issues in communication
	networks. In this paper, we develop an analytic model for this system
	using queueing theory and considering special impatience features.
	Simulation results show that (i) the developed model with impatience
	features can decrease burst loss probability (10%) compared with
	other approaches, and (ii) applying that model, we demonstrate that
	shared buffer architecture in optical burst switching network with
	optical buffer often achieves lower burst loss probability than dedicated
	buffer way in several different scenarios.},
